<p><em>iotarelr</em> is a package for estimating the components of the
Iota Reliability Concept. The first version of this concept is described
by Berding et al. (2022). The current version is Iota2 (Berding &amp;
Pargmann 2022).</p>
<p>In this vignette, we describe how to use the package on the basis of
the current version. We will show how to calculate and to interpret the
basic components. Advanced analyses are described with separate
vignettes which you can find via articles.</p>
<p>In order to use <em>iotarelr</em>, you need to load the package at
the beginning of your analysis.</p>

<p>In this introduction, we use a sample data set which is called
“iotarelr_written_exams”. The data set does not contain real data from
written exams. It is a data set which was created for illustration
purposes only. Let us have a look at it.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<span><span class="co">#&gt; 6    poor    poor average female</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The data set contains four columns. The first three columns contain
the ratings from three coders. That is, every written essay is scored by
three people. In terms of content analysis, three raters judged every
essay, representing the coding units. An essay can be rated as “poor”,
“average” or “good”. Thus, three categories are available. The fourth
column contains the gender of the person who wrote the essay. This
column, however, is not important at the moment. Such kinds of data can
be used to analyze if the codings work similarly across different groups
of people or different groups of materials. This kind of analysis is
described in the vignette <a href="dgf.html">Different Guidance
Functioning</a>. Keep in mind that at the moment, we are ignoring this
column.</p>
<p>The <em>Iota Concept</em> provides measures which allow to inspect
the reliability of single categories as well as a complete scale. This
is different from traditional measures of reliability for content
analysis, such as <em>Percentage Agreement</em>, <em>Cohen’s Kappa</em>
or <em>Krippendorff’s Alpha</em> which focus on the scale level only.
Since in the literature of content analysis, the terms “category”,
“scale” and “dimension” are used differently, it is important to
understand how the <em>Iota Concept</em> uses these terms. Figure 1
illustrates the understanding.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="iotarelr-terms.png" style="width:100.0%" alt=""><p class="caption">Figure 1: Scale and Categories in Iota Concept</p>
</div>
<p>Regarding our example, the performance in the exams is the scale
which is made up of three categories: “good”, “average” and “poor”.
Since the categories can be sorted by degree or performance, they form
an ordinal scale. An example for a nominal scale are colors. Here, the
different colors are the categories. They make up the scale “color”.</p>
<p>It is very important to note that the <em>Iota Concept</em>
differentiates between two layers of data, which are shown in Figure
2.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="iotarelr-introduction.png" style="width:100.0%" alt=""><p class="caption">Figure 2: Layers of Data within Iota Concept</p>
</div>
<p>The coding units are the units to which a coding scheme is applied.
In our example, these are the exams. Each exam has a <strong>true
category</strong>. That is, an exam is good, average or poor. These
categories make up the <strong>true data</strong>. However, the true
categories are not inherently known. Thus, raters use a coding scheme to
decide about the category of a coding unit. In the example, the raters
have to judge if an exam is good, average or poor and assign the
corresponding category to that coding unit/exam. All assignments make up
the <strong>labeled data</strong>.</p>
<p>However, it is not ensured that the assigned category is the same as
the true category. For example, in Figure 2, exam 1 is assigned to the
category “good”, which is also the true category. Exam 2 is also
assigned to the category “good”, although in truth, the exam represents
an average exam. Alike applies to exam 3. The assigned category and true
category should match, but this is not certain.</p>
<p>Since the assigned category and the true category may differ, the
labeled data can vary in the degree of how well it reflects the true
data. That is, the degree of overlapping between the true data and
labeled data can vary. In Figure 2, three exams are assigned to be good
exams. Thus, the data set contains three cases which are labeled as good
exams. Although the cases are labeled as good, only one case really is a
good exam. Thus, the true data and the labeled data for the category
“good” overlap by 33%. For the category “average”, true data and labeled
data overlap by 0% since there is one exam that in truth is an average
exam. However, there is no labeled data representing this. Something
similar applies for the category “poor”.</p>
<p>The aim of reliability is to ensure that the <strong>labeled
data</strong> matches the <strong>true data</strong> as well as
possible. To achieve this aim, the Iota Concept models the coding
process and provides measures for quantifying the degree of reliability
as shown in the following sections.</p>

<p>The calculation of all components of Iota2 can be requested by using
<code><a href="../reference/compute_iota2.html">compute_iota2()</a></code>. At this stage, it is crucial only to use
the part of the data set which contains the codings. In every case, the
coding units have to be in the rows and the raters in the columns. We
first save the codings in a new object, request the estimation of Iota2
and save the results.</p>

<p>The summary first shows basic information such as the number of
raters, the number of categories, the concrete categories and the number
of coding units. Next, the summary presents the log-likelihood which to
some extent describes the quality of the model. Lower values imply a
better fitting model than higher values. Additionally, the summary
prints whether or not the the best log-likelihood could be replicated.
If this is not the case, we recommend to increase the number of random
starts and/or to investigate the solutions to ensure that the subsequent
analyses are based on the best model possible .</p>

<p>Next, the summary shows the results for the primary parameters. These
are the <em>Assignment Error Matrix</em> and the <em>categorical
sizes</em>, which are the basis for all other measures of the <em>Iota
Concept</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Assignment Error Matrix</em> describes the rating process.
The true category is always in the rows and the assigned categories are
always in the columns. In the current example, the first row describes
how exams representing an average performance are assigned to the three
different categories. An exam representing an average performance is
assigned to be such an exam in about 91.7% of cases. In about 8.3% of
cases, an average exam is assigned to be a good exam. Finally, an
average exam is never assigned to be a poor exam. Here, the
corresponding probability is about 0%.</p>
<p>When concentrating on the exams which reflect a good performance, the
second row of the <em>Assignment Error Matrix</em> is important. In
about 49.3% of cases, a good exam is assigned as a good exam. In other
words: The probability to recognize a good exam as a good exam equals
flipping a coin. In about 32.6% of cases, a good exam is assigned to the
category “average”. That is, this exam is judged as showing an average
performance, although it is truly a good exam. Finally, a good exam is
rated as a “poor” exam in about 18.1% of cases. Thus, the raters make
more mistakes in evaluating a good exam than an average exam (49.3% for
good exams compared to 91.7% for average exams).</p>
<p>The <em>categorical sizes</em> represent an estimate for the
distribution of the <strong>true</strong> categories in the population.
In this example, we expect about 11.9% of all exams to be average, 39.6%
to be good and 48.5% to be poor.</p>
<p>Based on the <em>Assignment Error Matrix</em> and the <em>categorical
sizes</em>, additional measures of reliability can be derived. These are
shown in the next lines of the summary. The first is the <em>Alpha
Reliability</em>, which corresponds to the diagonal of the
<em>Assignment Error Matrix</em>. This determines the probability that a
coding unit of a specific category is correctly assigned to that
category. In this example, a coding unit truly belonging to the category
“average” is assigned to the category “average” in about 91.71% of
cases. In other words: An exam truly representing an average performance
is rated as an average exam in about 91.71% of cases. This value is
quite high. In contrast, the <em>Alpha Reliability</em> of the category
“good” is only .4933. This means that a coding unit truly belonging to
the category “good” is assigned “good” only in about 50% of cases. This
is quite a bad result. Alike applies for the category “poor”.</p>
<p>The next row presents the <em>Beta Reliability</em>, representing the
probability that errors on <strong>other</strong> categories do
<strong>not</strong> influence the category under investigation. In this
example, the <em>Beta Reliability</em> of the category “average” is
about .3718. This means that if a rater makes a mistake on the
categories “good” or “poor”, the mistake is <strong>not</strong>
assigned to the category “average” with a probability of 37.18%. In
other words: If a rater has to judge an exam which truly represents a
good or poor performance and if the rater does not recognize the good or
poor performance, they do <strong>not</strong> assign the exam to the
category “average” with a probability of 37.18% . Focusing on the
category “poor”, the <em>Beta Reliability</em> is about .6596. This
means: If a rater has to judge an exam which truly reflects an average
or a good performance and if the rater does not recognize the good or
average performance, they do <strong>not</strong> assign that exam as
poor in about 65.96 % of the cases. Thus, the <em>Beta Reliability</em>
can be used to show how errors on the other categories influence the
data generated for a specific category. The higher the values, the less
influenced the data for that category. In this example, the category
“average” is more influenced by errors on both of the other categories
than the categories “good” and “poor”.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>Iota Reliability</em> combines the <em>Alpha</em> and
the <em>Beta Reliability</em> by taking the sizes of the categories into
account. <em>Iota Reliability</em> is the core of the <em>Iota
Concept</em>. <em>Iota Reliability</em> is a measure that describes how
well the data labeled as a specific category really reflects that
category. It considers three cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>all cases which are assigned to the correct category
(<em>Iota</em>)</li>
<li>all cases of that category which are not recovered (<em>Iota Error
I</em>)</li>
<li>all cases that are assigned to that category although they truly
belong to another category (<em>Iota Error II</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we start to interpret these values for the case of the
example, some additional explanations are necessary. Figure 3
illustrates all three cases.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="iotarelr-iota.png" style="width:100.0%" alt=""><p class="caption">Figure 3: Illustrating Iota</p>
</div>
<p>Referring to the first row in Figure 3, the box represents all coding
units that <strong>truly</strong> belong to category <em>i</em>. In case
of perfect reliability, the <strong>labeled data</strong> corresponds to
these coding units.</p>
<p>Row two in Figure 3 splits the coding units of that category. The
green part of the box represents the coding units which in truth belong
to category <em>i</em> and which are part of the labeled data. The
yellow part of the box represents the number of coding units which in
truth belong to category <em>i</em>, but which are not assigned to
category <em>i</em>. These coding units are missing in the labeled data.
In the situation presented in row two, the total number of coding units
representing category <em>i</em> is underestimated in the labeled
data.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the third row to provide a complete view. The
<strong>labeled data</strong> of category <em>i</em> can also include
coding units that <strong>truly</strong> belong to
<strong>other</strong> categories. These coding units are represented by
the red box. They are results from coding errors made in other
categories and increase the number of units labeled as category
<em>i</em>, although in truth, they do not belong to category
<em>i</em>. Thus, these units contribute to an overestimation of the
number of coding units truly belonging to category <em>i</em>.</p>
<p><em>Iota</em> refers to the green box of row 3, <em>Iota Error I</em>
refers to the yellow box and <em>Iota Error II</em> refers to the red
box. All three measures are expressed as a ratio on <span class="math inline">\(N+n_{Iota Error II}\)</span>.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we can now interpret the <em>Iota
Reliability</em>. The easiest way is by visualizing the values. This can
be done with the function <code><a href="../reference/plot_iota.html">plot_iota()</a></code>.</p>

</div>
<p><strong><em>Category average:</em></strong> Let us start with the
category “average”. For this category, <em>Iota</em> is about .268. This
means that about 26.8% of the relevant labeled data really are average
exams. The remaining 73.2% represent average exams that are missing in
the results (<em>Iota Error I</em>) or represent exams that truly belong
to other categories (<em>Iota Error II</em>). With the help of the plot,
both of these cases can be characterized in more detail. The yellow
rectangle represents the average exams which are not part of the labeled
data. The number .024 indicates that only a few exams are “forgotten”.
The red rectangle describes the amount of exams that are part of the
labeled data for the average exams, but which are in truth good or poor
exams. They make up about 70% of the labeled data. To sum up, the data
representing the average exams</p>
<ul>
<li>recovers most of the exams that really are average exams
(<em>Iota</em>).</li>
<li>ignores only a small amount of exams which really are average exams
(<em>Iota Error I</em>).</li>
<li>is extremely biased by exams which in truth are good or poor
(<em>Iota Error II</em>). Their amount is greater than <em>Iota</em> and
<em>Iota Error I</em> combined, indicating that the number of coding
units for average exams is extremely overestimated by the labeled data
compared to the true data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, although the category “average” is quite reliable, the low
reliability of both of the other categories destroys the high quality of
the part of the data that should represent the average exams.</p>
<p><strong><em>Category good:</em></strong> Turning to the category
“good”, <em>Iota</em> is about .387, implying that about 38.7% of the
data labeled as “good exams” really are good exams. However, nearly the
same number of good exams are not represented in the data, as the yellow
rectangle in the plot shows. Thus, half of the good exams are missing in
the labeled data. <span class="math inline">\(\frac{.398}{.387+.398}=.507\)</span>. With a value
of .215, only about 21.5% of the data is made up by exams that truly
represent an average or a poor performance. Thus, the data labeled as
“good exams”</p>
<ul>
<li>only consists of exams which are in truth good exams to about 39%
(<em>Iota</em>).</li>
<li>ignores about 50 % of the exams which are in truth good exams
(<em>Iota Error I</em>).</li>
<li>is weakly biased by exams that are in truth average or poor exams
(<em>Iota Error II</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast to the data representing the average exams, the data
representing the good exams is not extremely biased by those from other
categories, but ignores a high number of relevant ones. Thus, the
labeled data underestimates the number of truly good exams compared to
the true data.</p>
<p><strong><em>Category poor:</em></strong> Finally, let’s have a look
at the category “poor”. Here, <em>Iota</em> is about .408, implying that
the relevant data consist to 40.8% of the correct coding units/exams.
However, <em>Iota Error I</em> is about .463, implying that a high
number of truly poor exams is not represented within the labeled data
for that category. <em>Iota Error II</em> is about .129 which is quite
low, implying that about 12.9% of the relevant data is made up of coding
units truly representing good or average exams. Thus, the data
representing the poor exams</p>
<ul>
<li>consists only to about 40.8% of exams which are in truth poor exams
(<em>Iota</em>).</li>
<li>ignores about 53.2% of the exams which are in truth poor exams
(<em>Iota Error I</em>).</li>
<li>is weakly biased by exams that are in truth good or average exams
(<em>Iota Error II</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of poor exams is underestimated by the labeled data
compared to the true data.</p>
<p><strong><em>Summary:</em></strong> To sum up, the sample coding
scheme guiding the ratings of the exams requires a revision. The data
generated by the coding scheme is heavily biased in favor of average
exams. The number of average exams is overestimated since a lot of good
and poor exams are treated as average exams. As a consequence, the
number of good and poor exams is underestimated. Since the <em>Alpha
Reliability</em> of the category “average” is quite high, a revision
should focus on the categories “good” and “poor”. This revision should
aim to provide more precise definitions and clearer or more suitable
examples that support raters in perceiving the true categories of the
exams.</p>

<p>Since version 0.1.3, <em>ioatrelr</em> provides an additional
analysis possibility via the function
<code><a href="../reference/plot_iota2_alluvial.html">plot_iota2_alluvial()</a></code>. This function takes an an estimated
object of Iota2 and returns a plot representing the coding process
guided by a coding scheme. For the current example, the plot is shown in
Figure 5.</p>

<p>The boxes on the left side represent how the true categories are
distributed in the population. Their height directly reflects the
estimated true categorical sizes. The boxes on the right side show the
amounts in the labeled data. The curves between the two pairs of boxes
illustrate the coding process.</p>
<p><strong>Average exams:</strong> Concentrating on the true average
exams, the plot illustrates that most of the true average exams are part
of the labeled data. This can be seen by the big red curve ranging from
the true average exams to the labeled average exams. Only a very small
number of true average exams is assigned as good exams. This can be seen
on the very small red curve ranging from the true average exams to the
good exams. Thus, most of the true average exams are correctly
assigned.</p>
<p>However, the box for the labeled average exams is several times
larger than the box for the true average exams. This indicates that the
coding scheme tends to overestimate the number of average exams. Figure
5 illustrates that the source for this overestimation is in the truly
good and the truly poor exams. This can be seen by the big green curve
ranging from the truly good exams to the labeled average exams and by
the big blue curve ranging from the truly poor exams to the labeled
average exams.</p>
<p><strong>Good exams:</strong> A similar analysis is possible for the
good exams. The three green curves ranging from the truly good exams to
the other categories illustrate how the truly good exams are assigned to
the different possible categories. The two big curves show that most of
the truly good exams are assigned to the categories “good” and
“average”. The smaller green curve indicates that a smaller number of
truly good exams are assigned to the category of poor exams. The box for
the truly good exams is smaller than the box for the labeled good exams
indicating that the labeled data underestimates the number of good
exams. The coding units behind the labeled data for the good exams is
made up mostly by truly good exams (big green curve) followed by a high
number of truly poor exams (big blue curve) and only a very small number
of truly average exams (red curve).</p>
<p><strong>Poor exams:</strong> Finally, the box for the labeled poor
exams is about 0.5 times smaller than the box for the truly poor exams,
indicating that the total number of poor exams is underestimated by the
coding scheme. The three blue curves illustrate that most of the truly
poor exams are assigned to the category “poor” in the labeled data. A
similar number of truly poor exams is assigned to the category “average”
and only a smaller number is assigned to the category “good”.</p>
<p>Summing up, the alluvial plot for Iota2 provides additional insights
into how a coding scheme works by illustrating the coding stream and
splitting up <em>Iota</em>, <em>Iota Error I</em> and <em>Iota Error
II</em> into more detail.This can be very helpful for judging the
quality of data and for reviewing a coding scheme.</p>

</h3>
<p>In many cases, not only the reliability of singles categories is
important but also the reliability of the complete scale. The <em>Iota
Concept</em> provides several measures for characterizing this kind of
reliability. Currently, we recommend to use the <em>Dynamic Iota
Index</em>. This measure ranges from 0 to 1, 0 indicating the absence of
reliability, 1 indicating a perfect reliability. Referring to the
summary above, the <em>Dynamic Iota Index</em> is about .267. This is a
low value which replicates the analysis on the categorical level.</p>
<p>According to the the rules of thumb developed by Berding and Pargmann
(2022), this value is not sufficient to generate reliable data. The
value should be at least .829 to allow subsequent statistical analysis
such as correlation analysis or significance testing. This is due to the
fact that this degree of reliability leads to high deviations from the
true sample correlation and suffers from a high risk of drawing wrong
conclusions from statistical analyses.</p>
