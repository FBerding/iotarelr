Description: The package provides tools for estimating the components and 
    elements of the Iota Reliability Concept. The Iota Reliability Concept can
    be applied for any kind of content analysis which uses a standardized
    coding scheme. The concept provides reliability measures for the complete 
    scale as well as for every single category. This information can support the
    development process of a coding scheme and allows a detailed inspection
    of the quality of data generated by content anaylsis.
