Description: 
    Routines and tools for assessing the quality
    of content analysis on the basis of the Iota Reliability Concept. The concept
    is inspired by item response theory and can be applied to any kind of 
    content analysis which uses a standardized coding scheme and discrete categories.
    It is also applicable for content analysis conducted by artificial intelligence. 
    The package provides reliability measures for a complete scale as well as for 
    every single category. Analysis of subgroup-invariance and error corrections 
    are implemented. This information can support the development process of a 
    coding scheme and allows a detailed inspection of the quality of the generated data.
