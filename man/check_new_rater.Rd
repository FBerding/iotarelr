\usage{
check_new_rater(
  true_values,
  assigned_values,
  con_step_size = 1e-04,

\arguments{
\item{true_values}{\code{Vector} containing the true categories of the coding
units. Vector must have the same length as \code{assigned_values}.}

\item{assigned_values}{\code{Vector} containing the assigned
categories of the coding units. Missing values are currently not supported and
have to be omitted from the vector. Vector must have the same length as
\code{true_values}.}

\item{con_step_size}{\code{Double} for specifying the size for increasing or
decreasing the probabilities during the conditioning stage of estimation.
This value should not be less than 1e-3.}

\item{con_random_starts}{\code{Integer} for the number of random starts
within the condition stage.}

\item{con_max_iterations}{\code{Integer} for the maximum number of iterations
during the conditioning stage.}

\item{con_rel_convergence}{\code{Double} for determining the convergence
criterion during the conditioning stage. The algorithm stops if the relative change
is smaller than this criterion.}

\item{con_trace}{\code{TRUE} for printing progress information on the console
during estimations in the conditioning stage. \code{FALSE} if you do not want to have
this information printed.}

\item{fast}{\code{Bool} If \code{TRUE} a fast estimation is applied during the
condition stage. This option ignores all parameters beginning with "con_".
If \code{FALSE} the estimation described in Berding and
Pargmann (2022) is used. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{free_aem}{\code{Bool} If \code{TRUE} the Assignment Error Matrix is
estimated in a way ensuring conformity with the assumption of weak superiority.
if \code{FALSE} the Assignment Error Matrix is freely estimated. \code{TRUE}
is default.}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{list} with the following three components:
The first component \code{estimates_categorical_level} comprises all
elements that describe the ratings on a categorical level. The elements are
sub-divided into raw estimates and chance-corrected estimates.
\describe{
\item{\code{raw_estimates}}{
\itemize{
\item{\code{alpha_reliability: }}{A vector containing the Alpha
Reliabilities for each category. These values represent probabilities.}
\item{\code{beta_reliability: }}{A vector containing the Beta Reliabilities for each
category. These values represent probabilities.}
\item{\code{assignment_error_matrix: }}{An Assignment Error Matrix containing the conditional
probabilities for assigning a unit of category i to categories 1 to n.}
#' \item{\code{iota: }}
{A vector containing the Iota values for each category.}
}}
\item{\code{elements_chance_corrected}}{
\itemize{
\item{\code{alpha_reliability: }}
{A vector containing the chance-corrected Alpha Reliabilities for each category.}
\item{\code{beta_reliability: }}
{A vector containing the chance-corrected Beta Reliabilities for each category.}
}}
}
The second component \code{estimates_scale_level} contains elements to
describe the quality of the ratings on a scale level. It contains the
following elements:
\itemize{
\item{\code{iota_index: }}
{The Iota Index representing the reliability on a scale level.}
\item{\code{iota_index_d4: }}
{The Static Iota Index, which is a transformation of the original Iota Index,
in order to consider the uncertainty of estimation.}
\item{\code{iota_index_dyn2: }}
{The Dynamic Iota Index, which is a transformation of the original Iota Index,
in order to consider the uncertainty of estimation.}
}
The third component \code{information} contains important information
regarding the parameter estimation. It comprises the following elements:
\itemize{
\item{\code{log_likelihood: }}
{Log-likelihood of the best solution.}
\item{\code{convergence: }}
{If estimation converged 0, otherwise 1.}
\item{\code{est_true_cat_sizes: }}
{Estimated categorical sizes. This is the estimated amount of the categories.}
\item{\code{conformity: }}
{\code{0} if the solution is in line with assumptions of weak superiority.
 A number greater 0 indicates the number of violations of the assumption
 of weak superiority.}
 \item{\code{random_starts: }}
{Numer of random starts for the EM algorithm.}
\item{\code{boundaries: }}
{\code{False} if the best solution does not contain boundary values.
\code{True} if the best solution does contain boundary values}
\item{\code{p_boundaries: }}
{Percentage of solutions with boundary values during estimation.}
\item{\code{call: }}
{Name of the function that created the object.}
\item{\code{n_rater: }}
{Number of raters.}
\item{\code{n_cunits: }}
{Number of coding units.}
}
}
\description{
Function for estimating the reliability of codings for a new rater based on
Iota 2
}
\note{
The returned object contains further slots since the returned object is
of class \code{iotarelr_iota2}. These slots are empty because they are not part of the
estimation within this function.

Please do not use the measures on the scale level if the Assignment Error Matrix
was freely estimated since this kind of matrix is not conceptualized for comparing
the coding process with random guessing.
