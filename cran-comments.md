Thank you for your feedback on our first submission. We addressed the following
aspects:

-1 Aspect

*I think there are too many blank spaces in your description text. Please check that.*

We applied usethis::use_tidy_description to clean the description file

-2 Aspect

*If there are references describing the methods in your package, please add these in the description field of your DESCRIPTION file in the form authors (year) <doi:...> authors (year) <arXiv:...> authors (year, ISBN:...) or if those are not available: <https:...> with no space after 'doi:', 'arXiv:', 'https:' and angle brackets for auto-linking. (If you want to add a title as well please put it in quotes: "Title")*

We added two references at the end of the description field.


We hope everything is fine now. Please give us a short feedback.
Thank you
